## Relational Databases

SQL Server is a relational database management system. One of the key principles of a relational database is that data is stored across multiple tables.

## Keys

* A **primary key** is a column that is used to uniquely identify each row in a table. This uniqueness can be achieved by using a *sequential integer* as an identity column.

* A **Foreign Key**

## INNER JOIN

Perform an inner join between album and track using the album_id column.


```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT 
  track_id,
  name AS track_name,
  title AS album_title
FROM track
  -- Complete the join type and the common joining column
INNER JOIN album on track.album_id = album.album_id;

-- other example 

-- Select album_id and title from album, and name from artist
SELECT 
  album_id,
  title, 
  name AS artist
  -- Enter the main source table name
FROM album
  -- Perform the inner join
INNER JOIN artist on album.artist_id = artist.artist_id;

```
