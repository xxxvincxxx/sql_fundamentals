## Inner Join

...

## INNER JOIN via `USING`

* Basically when you join on the same name on each of the 2 tables.

```{sql eval=FALSE}
add stuff
```

## "Self-join" & `CASE`

* A table joined with it-self
* ... compare values in a field within the same table

```{sql eval=FALSE}
  CASE WHEN indep_year < 1900 THEN 'before 1900'
       WHEN indep_year <= 1930 THEN 'between 1900 and 1930' END
       ELSE "after" END
       AS something_name column

```
