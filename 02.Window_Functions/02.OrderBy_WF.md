ORDER BY in Window Functions
================

## ORDER BY

``` sql
```

  - `ORDER BY` is a subclause of `OVER`
  - It orders the rows related to the current row that the window
    function will use.

## Reigning champion

  - One of the applications of window functions is determining reigning
    champion status. A reigning champion is a champion who’s **won both
    the previous and current years’ competitions**. To determine if a
    champion is a reigning champion, the previous and the current years’
    champions need to be in the same row, in two different columns, so
    that they can be compared. How can you get a previous row’s value
    without complex self-joins?

  - Enter `LAG`. `LAG` is a window function that takes a column and a
    number n and returns the column’s value n rows before the current
    row. Passing 1 as n returns the previous row’s value.
