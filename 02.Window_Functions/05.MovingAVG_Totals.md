Moving averages and totals
================

## Moving averages and totals

  - A moving average is the average of the last n periods of a column’s
    values.
  - It catches momentum and trends; in sales, epidemiology.
  - Moving averages are also useful in eliminating seasonality, the
    normal fluctuation of units sold per day.

## Moving total

  - the sum of the last n periods of a column’s values. For example, the
    sum of the last 3 Olympic games’ medals for any given set of Olympic
    games. It’s used to indicate performance in the recent periods; if
    the sum is going down, overall performance is going down, and
    vice-versa.
