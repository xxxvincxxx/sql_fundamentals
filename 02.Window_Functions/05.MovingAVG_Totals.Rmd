## Moving averages and totals

* A moving average is the average of the last n periods of a column's values.
* It catches momentum and trends; in sales, epidemiology.
* Moving averages are also useful in eliminating seasonality, the normal fluctuation of units sold per day.

## Moving total
* the sum of the last n periods of a column's values. For example, the sum of the last 3 Olympic games' medals for any given set of Olympic games. It's used to indicate performance in the recent periods; if the sum is going down, overall performance is going down, and vice-versa.

--> use `OVER`

### Exercise 1 

* Calculate the 3-year moving average of medals earned.

```{sql eval=FALSE}
WITH Russian_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'RUS'
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 1980
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  Year, Medals,
  --- Calculate the 3-year moving average of medals earned
  AVG(Medals) OVER
    (ORDER BY Year ASC
     ROWS BETWEEN
     2 preceding AND current row) AS Medals_MA
FROM Russian_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;
```

### Exercise 2

* Calculate the 3-year moving sum of medals earned.

```{sql eval=FALSE}
WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  GROUP BY Year, Country)

SELECT
  Year, Country, Medals,
  -- Calculate each country's 3-game moving total
  sum(Medals) OVER
    (PARTITION BY Country
     ORDER BY Year ASC
     ROWS BETWEEN
     2 preceding AND current row) AS Medals_MA
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
```
