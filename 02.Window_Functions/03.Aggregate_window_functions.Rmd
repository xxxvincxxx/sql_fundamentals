## Aggregate window functions

* What if you want to see the maximum medals earned so far, or calculate the cumulative sum of medals earned?

* You can use both `MAX` and `SUM`, as well as the other aggregate functions `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `AVG`, as window functions

## SUM Window function: **Running Totals** ❤️
