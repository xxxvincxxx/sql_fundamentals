Window functions perform an operation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row, which is the row the window function's currently operating on. 
&nbsp;

They're similar to `GROUP BY` aggregate functions in that they span multiple rows but:

* **instead of rows being grouped into a single row** 

* ... all rows remain in the **output**. 
&nbsp;

## Row numbers

The most basic thing you can do with a window function is assign **row numbers**. 
&nbsp;

The parentheses after `OVER` can be empty, just like the previous example, but they can also contain subclauses, such as:

* `ORDER BY`
* `PARTITION BY` 
* `ROWS` or `RANGE PRECEDING`
* ... `FOLLOWING`
* `UNBOUNDED`
