## Window functions

Window functions perform an operation across a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row, which is the row the window function's currently operating on. They're similar to `GROUP BY` aggregate functions in that they span multiple rows, but **instead of rows being grouped into a single row**, all rows remain in the **output**.

## Row numbers

The most basic thing you can do with a window function is assign **row numbers**.

Row numbers allow you to reference a row by its position or index as opposed to its values. You can fetch the 5th row no matter what its values are, for example.
