Window Functions
================

Window functions perform an operation across a set of rows that are
somehow related to the current row, which is the row the window
function’s currently operating on.  

They’re similar to `GROUP BY` aggregate functions in that they span
multiple rows but:

  - **instead of rows being grouped into a single row**

  - … all rows remain in the **output**.  

## Row numbers

The most basic thing you can do with a window function is assign **row
numbers**.  

The parentheses after `OVER` can be empty, just like the previous
example, but they can also contain subclauses, such as:

  - `ORDER BY`
  - `PARTITION BY`
  - `ROWS` or `RANGE PRECEDING`
  - … `FOLLOWING`
  - `UNBOUNDED`
