Pivoting
================

CROSSTAB allows you to pivot a table by **a certain column**

  - CREATE EXTENSION statement before using CROSSTAB.

<!-- end list -->

``` sql
-- Create the correct extention to enable CROSSTAB
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB($$
  SELECT
    Gender, Year, Country
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Year IN (2008, 2012)
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Event = 'Pole Vault'
  ORDER By Gender ASC, Year ASC;
-- Fill in the correct column names for the pivoted table
$$) AS ct (Gender VARCHAR,
           "2008" VARCHAR,
           "2012" VARCHAR)

ORDER BY Gender ASC;
```

  - The **tablefunc extension** enables the CROSSTAB function.

  - The ct column names are the unpivoted column (Gender) and the unique
    values of the pivoted column (2008 and 2012). Make sure to surround
    the years with double quotes when listing them as column names.
