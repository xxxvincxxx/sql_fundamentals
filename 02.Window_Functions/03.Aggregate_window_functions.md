================

## Aggregate window functions

  - What if you want to see the maximum medals earned so far, or
    calculate the cumulative sum of medals earned?

  - You can use both `MAX` and `SUM`, as well as the other aggregate
    functions `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `AVG`, as window functions

## `SUM()` Window function: **Running Totals** ❤️

``` sql
-- basically a TEMP table
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'USA' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

-- running calculation
  -- Calculate the running total of athlete medals
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  SUM(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY Athlete ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;
```

## `MAX()` Window function: **Running Totals** ❤️

``` sql
WITH Country_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, Country, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('CHN', 'KOR', 'JPN')
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year, Country)

SELECT
  -- Return the max medals earned so far per country
  year,
  country,
  medals,
  MAX(medals) OVER (PARTITION BY country
                ORDER BY year ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Country_Medals
ORDER BY Country ASC, Year ASC;
```

## `MIN()` Window function: **Running Totals** ❤️

``` sql
WITH France_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'FRA'
    AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  year,
  medals,
  MIN(medals) OVER (ORDER BY year ASC) AS Min_Medals
FROM France_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;
```
