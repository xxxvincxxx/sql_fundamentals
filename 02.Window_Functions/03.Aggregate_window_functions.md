================

## Aggregate window functions

  - What if you want to see the maximum medals earned so far, or
    calculate the cumulative sum of medals earned?

  - You can use both `MAX` and `SUM`, as well as the other aggregate
    functions `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `AVG`, as window functions

## SUM Window function: **Running Totals** ❤️

  - boh?

<!-- end list -->

``` sql
-- basically a TEMP table
WITH Athlete_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'USA' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

-- running calculation
  -- Calculate the running total of athlete medals
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  SUM(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY Athlete ASC) AS Max_Medals
FROM Athlete_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;
```
