## Distributions

* `TRUNC()` vs. `ROUND()`
* `generate_series(from,to,step)` -> to create bins

## Correlation

* A correlation coefficient can range from 1 to -1, with larger values indicating a stronger positive relationship, and more negative values indicating a stronger negative relationship.

* The corr function takes the names of two columns as arguments and returns the correlation between them. *Rows with a null value in either column are excluded*

## Median
