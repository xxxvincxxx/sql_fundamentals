## LEFT / RIGHT JOINS 

* left join
* right join
* full join 

(... basically outer-joins; expect the inner-join)

### FULL JOINs

### Exercise 1

* Combines LEFT & RIGHT joins

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- From countries
FROM countries
  -- Join to currencies
  FULL JOIN currencies
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- Order by region
ORDER BY region;
```

* Repeat the same query again with `INNER JOIN` instead of a `FULL JOIN`. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN and LEFT JOIN results

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- From countries
FROM countries
  -- Join to currencies
  INNER JOIN currencies
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- Order by region
ORDER BY region;
```

### Exercise 2

* Choose records in which countries.name starts with the capital letter 'V' or is NULL.
* Arrange by countries.name in ascending order to more clearly see the results.

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  FULL JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;
```

### Exercise 3

* Repeat the same query as before, using a LEFT JOIN instead of a FULL JOIN. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN result!

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  LEFT JOIN countries
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;
```

### Exercise 4

* Repeat once more, but use an `INNER JOIN` instead of a `LEFT JOIN`. Note what has changed?
&nbsp;

* Honestly: **boh?!**

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- From languages
FROM languages
  -- Join to countries
  INner Join countries
    -- Match using code
    USING (code)
-- Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- Order by ascending countries.name
Order by countries.name;

```
