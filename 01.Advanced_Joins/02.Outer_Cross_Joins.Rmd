## LEFT / RIGHT JOINS 

* left join
* right join
* full join 

(... basically outer-joins; expect the inner-join)

### FULL JOINs

* Combines LEFT & RIGHT joins

```{sql eval=FALSE}
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- From countries
FROM countries
  -- Join to currencies
  FULL JOIN currencies
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- Order by region
ORDER BY region;
```

* Repeat the same query again with `INNER JOIN` instead of a `FULL JOIN`. Note what has changed compared to the FULL JOIN and LEFT JOIN results
