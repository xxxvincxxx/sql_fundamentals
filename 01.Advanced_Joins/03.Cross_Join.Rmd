## Cross-Joins

`CROSS JOIN`s create all possible combinations of two tables.

### Code version with **`CROSS JOIN`** syntax (Cartesian Product?):

```{sql eval=FALSE}
-- Select fields
SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language
-- From cities (alias as c)
FROM cities AS c        
  -- Join to languages (alias as l)
  CROSS JOIN languages AS l
-- Where c.name like Hyderabad
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';
```

### Code version with **`INNER JOIN`** syntax (Cartesian Product?):

```{sql eval=FALSE}
-- Select f-- Select fields
SELECT c.name AS city, l.name AS language
-- From cities (alias as c)
FROM cities AS c        
  -- Join to languages (alias as l)
  INNER JOIN languages AS l
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.country_code = l.code
-- Where c.name like Hyderabad
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';KE 'Hyder%';
```
