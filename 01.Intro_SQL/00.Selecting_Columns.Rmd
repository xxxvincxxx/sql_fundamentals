```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Number of rows
```{sql, eval=FALSE}
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people;
```

## Count the number of (non-missing) values


It's also common to combine `COUNT()` with `DISTINCT` to count the number of distinct values in a column.

```{sql, eval=FALSE}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)
FROM people;
```
